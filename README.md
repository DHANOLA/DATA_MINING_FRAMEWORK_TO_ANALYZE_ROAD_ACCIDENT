# **DATA MINING FRAMEWORK TO ANALYZE ROAD ACCIDENT**
***In this system we will use different data mining algorithms to analyze the data.
Different algorithms are applied to group the accident locations into clusters and
mining techniques are used to characterize the locations. Most state of the art
traffic management and information systems focus on data analysis.***


***Apart from analysis focus has been done towards the sense of classification. So
our system also uses classification techniques to predict the severity of the
accident which will bring out the factors behind road accidents that occurred
and a predictive model is constructed using fuzzy logic to predict the location
wise accident frequency. This system uses road accidents data to mine frequent
patterns and important factors causing different types of accidents.***
